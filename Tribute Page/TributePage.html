            <blockquote id="xyz"> And the Six Paths of <i>Pain</i></blockquote>
            <div id="dp"></div>
            <p>Nagato (長門, Nagato) was a shinobi of Amegakure and descendant of the Uzumaki clan. Forming Akatsuki
                alongside his friends (and fellow war orphans) Yahiko and Konan, Nagato dreamed of bringing peace to the
                violent shinobi world. However, following Yahiko's death, Nagato adopted the alias of Pain (ペイン, Pein)
                and, along with Konan, began leading a new Akatsuki; one that would force the world into peace using any
                means necessary.</p>

            <h5>Six Paths of Pain</h5>
            <p>
                With the Outer Path, Nagato could form what he calls his "Six Paths of Pain". By embedding black
                receivers throughout the bodies of six corpses – arranged to resemble body piercings – Nagato was able
                to control all of them remotely as though they were his own. He could control the Paths across great
                distances, but for more chakra-demanding techniques, it was necessary for the Path to first be brought
                closer to his position. An alternative to this was cutting off control of five of the Paths and focusing
                all of his chakra into one. The Paths can be used to react to threats in mere seconds and, because they
                are corpses, the bodies are unfazed by all but the most debilitating types of damage.
            </p>
            <p>
                In theory, each of the Six Paths of Pain could be used to perform any technique that Nagato himself was
                capable of. In practice, however, he limited each body to one branch of the Six Paths Techniques, the
                exception being the Deva Path through which he performed a number of miscellaneous jutsu. Each Path
                served a specific purpose, be it offensive, defensive, reconnaissance or repair. None of the Paths
                specifically specialised in taijutsu, but all were able to keep pace during hand-to-hand combat with
                even the most practised opponent. Though he considered all six Paths to be part of the Pain identity he
                gave himself, Nagato still regarded them as separate entities from himself, referring to them by
                whichever Path they embody.[37]
            </p>
            <p>
                Although the Six Paths were individually strong, they were at their most formidable when used together,
                with the simultaneous use of all six being the primary reason for Pain's infamous invincibility.[38]
                This was because the six Paths, as well as the Animal Path's summons and the King of Hell, let Nagato
                share their vision,[39] allowing him to coordinate their movements with maximum efficiency. They could
                attack from multiple angles and dodge attacks they couldn't have seen but that occurred within another
                Path's field of vision. During his attack on Konoha, when the Six Paths were dispersed throughout the
                village to act strategically, they managed to wreak devastation and kill many powerful shinobi,
                effectively allowing Nagato to almost singlehandedly overpower the village. Each of the Paths had its
                own importance in a fight – the Naraka Path's ability to restore all the other Paths, making it the most
                valuable – and therefore, Nagato would sacrifice other Paths to protect those further up the hierarchy.
            </p>
            <p>
                Despite the advantages the six bodies granted him in a fight, Nagato tried to limit his usage to as few
                bodies as possible to reduce the likelihood of anyone discovering the secret of how the Six Paths of
                Pain work. When Konoha began to understand the idiosyncrasies of the ability, he destroyed the village
                in an effort to kill anyone who might know that none of the six Paths were the real him.
            </p>

            <p>
                Because of the limitations of his real body, Nagato had few chances to use any of these abilities directly. When the
                opportunity arose, though, he could shift between the different Paths seamlessly and instantly, performing
                the many abilities on a level he wasn't capable of when using them through others.
